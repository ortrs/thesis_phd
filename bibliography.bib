 abstract = {Quantum simulation of spin models can provide insight into problems that are difficult or impossible to study with classical computers. Trapped ions are an established platform for quantum simulation, but only systems with fewer than 20 ions have demonstrated quantum correlations. We studied quantum spin dynamics arising from an engineered, homogeneous Ising interaction in a two-dimensional array of (9)Be(+) ions in a Penning trap. We verified entanglement in spin-squeezed states of up to 219 ions, directly observing 4.0 $\pm$ 0.9 decibels of spectroscopic enhancement, and observed states with non-Gaussian statistics consistent with oversqueezed states. The good agreement with ab initio theory that includes interactions and decoherence lays the groundwork for simulations of the transverse-field Ising model with variable-range interactions, which are generally intractable with classical methods.},

 abstract = {This perspective summarizes highlights and most recent advances in tin cluster chemistry, thereby addressing the whole diversity of (mostly) discrete units containing tin atoms. Although being a (semi-)metallic element, tin is in the position to occur both in formally positive or negative oxidation states in these molecules, which causes a broad range of fundamentally different properties of the corresponding compounds. Tin(iv) compounds are not as oxophilic and not as prone to hydrolysis as related Si or Ge compounds, hence allowing for easier handling and potential application. Nevertheless, their reactivity is high due to an overall reduction of bond energies, which makes tin clusters interesting candidates for functional compounds. Beside aspects that point towards bioactivity or even medical applications, materials composed of naked or ligand-protected tin clusters, with or without bridging ligands, show interesting optical, and ion/molecule-trapping properties.},

Silicon nitride waveguides (Si3N4) in the anomalous dispersion region have shown efficient supercontinuum generation spanning an octave-bandwidth.

Compounds 5-8 share a common structural motif with two intact {PhTE3 } units coordinating a Cu6 moiety, which was previously reported with other ligands, and for the Sn and Ge congeners only. If the Sn/Se reaction system was allowed to crystallize more slowly, single crystals of compound [(CuPPh3 )6 (PhSnSe3 )3 Cu3 SnSe] (9) were obtained, which are based on a larger cluster structure. Hence, 9 might form from 8 through incorporation of additional cluster fragments. The experimentally and quantum chemically determined optical properties were compared to related clusters.},

@article{Schwan.2023,
 abstract = {A class of adamantane-like molecular materials attracts attention because they exhibit an extreme non-linear optical response and emit a broad white-light spectrum after illumination with a continuous-wave infrared laser source. According to recent studies, not only the nature of the cluster molecules, but also the macroscopic structure of the materials determines their non-linear optical properties. Here we present a systematic study of cluster dimers of the compounds AdR4 and [(RT)4 S6 ] (T~=~Si, Ge, Sn) with R~=~methyl, phenyl or 1-naphthyl to gain fundamental knowledge about the interactions in the materials. For all compounds, a similar type of dimer structures with a staggered arrangement of substituents was determined as the energetically most favorable configuration. The binding energy between the dimers, determined by including London dispersion interactions, increases with the size of the core and the substituents. The cluster interactions can be classified as substituent-substituent-dominated (small cores, large substituents) or core-core-dominated (large cores, small substituents). Among various possible dimer conformers, those with small core-core distances are energetically preferred. Trimer and tetramer clusters display similar trends regarding the minimal core-core distances and binding energies. The much lower energy barrier determined for the rotation of substituents as compared to the rotation of the cluster dimers past each other indicates that the rotation of substituents more easily leads to different conformers in the material. Thus, understanding the interaction of the cluster dimers allows an initial assessment of the interactions in the materials.},

Materials exhibiting strong nonlinear optical properties, in particular second-harmonic generation (SHG) or white-light generation (WLG), have therefore been investigated with great activity in recent times. While many new approaches have been reported until now, the processability of the compounds remains a challenge. Here, a new class of materials, denoted as {\textquotedbl}cluster-glass{\textquotedbl}, which do not only show superior white-light emission properties upon irradiation by an inexpensive continuous-wave infrared laser diode, but can be easily accommodated in size and shape by formation of robust glassy solids, is introduced. The cluster-glass materials are fabricated by mild heating from crystalline powders of adamantane-type clusters exhibiting a quaternary, inorganic-organic hybrid cluster core [(PhSi)(CH2 )3 (PhSn)E3 ] (E~ = ~S, Se, Te). The process is fully reversible and preserves the integrity of the clusters in the glass, as proven by solution spectroscopy and recrystallization. Theoretical studies corroborate the importance of the quaternary nature of the cluster cores for the observed structural and optical phenomena. Thanks to these findings, high-brilliance white-light sources can be synthesized in form of stable, robust glass of any shape, which ultimately renders them suitable for everyday's applications.},

@article{Vasco.,
 abstract = {The microscopic structure of two amorphous materials with extreme nonlinear optical properties has been studied. One of these materials exhibits second harmonic generation, while another material of similar molecular structure emits brilliant white light if being irradiated with a simple IR laser diode. Structural differences were investigated using X-ray scattering and EXAFS combined with molecular RMC. Transmission electron microscopy and scanning precession electron diffraction were used to understand specific structural differences on all length scales, from mesoscopic down to mutual molecular arrangements. Characteristic differences were found at all scales. Close core-core spacing between {SnS} clusters as well as characteristic cluster distortions appear to be characteristic features of the white light emitting material. In the other material, cores are undistorted and core distances are larger. There, the formation of nanocrystalline structures in the amorphous matrix could also be identified as reason for the WLG suppression.

Under certain conditions, the incoherence may even enhance, rather than suppress, the instability. In particular, it is found that the range of modulationally unstable wave numbers does not necessarily decrease monotonically with increasing degree of incoherence and that the modulational instability may still exist even when long wavelength perturbations are stable.},

@article{Castellan.2019,
 abstract = {Strained silicon waveguides have been proposed to break the silicon centrosymmetry, which inhibits second-order nonlinearities. Even if electro-optic effect and second harmonic generation (SHG) were measured, the published results presented plenty of ambiguities due to the concurrence of different effects affecting the process. In this work, the origin of SHG in a silicon waveguide strained by a silicon nitride cladding is investigated in detail. From the measured SHG efficiencies, an effective second-order nonlinear susceptibility of {\~{}}0.5 pmV-1 is extracted. To evidence the role of strain, SHG is studied under an external mechanical load, demonstrating no significant dependence on the applied stress. On the contrary, a 254 nm ultraviolet (UV) exposure of the strained silicon waveguide suppresses completely the SHG signal. Since UV irradiation is known to passivate charged defects accumulated in the silicon nitride cladding, this measurement evidences the crucial role of charged centers. In fact, charged defects cause an electric field in the waveguide that via the third order silicon nonlinearity induces the SHG. This conclusion is supported by numerical simulations, which accurately model the experimental results.},

@article{Chejarla.2023,
 abstract = {Characterizing long-range electric fields and built-in potentials in functional materials at nano to micrometer scales is of supreme importance for optimizing devices, e.g., the functionality of semiconductor hetero-structures or battery materials is determined by the electric fields established at interfaces which can also vary spatially. In this study, momentum-resolved four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) is proposed for the quantification of these potentials and the optimization steps required to reach quantitative agreement with simulations for the GaAs/AlAs hetero-junction model system are shown. Using STEM the differences in the mean inner potentials (∆MIP) of two materials forming an interface and resulting dynamic diffraction effects have to be considered. This study shows that the measurement quality is significantly improved by precession, energy filtering and a off-zone-axis alignment of the specimen. Complementary simulations yielding a ∆MIP of 1.3~V confirm that the potential drop due to charge transfer at the intrinsic interface is $\approx$0.1~V, in agreement with experimental and theoretical values found in literture. These results show the feasibility of accurately measuring built-in potentials across hetero-interfaces of real device structures and its promising application for more complex interfaces of other polycrystalline materials on the nanometer scale.},

 abstract = {An inelastic x-ray scattering experiment has been performed on molten NaCl over wide wave vector and energy transfer ranges. Data of high statistical quality are analyzed using a memory function approach within a generalized Langevin equation. The approach with two relaxation times for the memory function provides a very good data description over the whole wave vector range beyond the hydrodynamic regime. A slow thermal and a fast structural relaxation process in the memory function completely define the density fluctuations in molten NaCl and evidences the thermal-viscoelastic model as the minimal description for collective particle dynamics in molten alkali halides. The obtained excitation frequencies demonstrate a large positive dispersion effect, which can be related to the viscoelastic reaction of the molten salt. A transition from the viscoelastic to a hydrodynamic response of the molten salt at small wave vectors is observed. In the hydrodynamic regime the resulting thermal diffusivity agrees well with values obtained through light scattering. The modeling indicates some deficiencies at small wave vectors and large energy transfers and the spectra of the current correlation function evidences additional intensity at high frequency. The frequency of these additional modes approach a non-zero value at zero wave vector and indicates a non-acoustic character of these excitations. The frequency center of this additional inelastic intensity coincides with optic-type modes in molten NaCl predicted by simulations.},

Here we show that quasi-phase-matching via periodic modulations of the waveguide structure provides a useful mechanism to control the evolution of ultrafast pulses during supercontinuum generation. We experimentally demonstrate a quasi-phase-matched supercontinuum to the TE{\_}{20} and TE{\_}{00} waveguide modes, which enhances the intensity of the SCG in specific spectral regions by as much as 20~dB. We utilize higher-order quasi-phase-matching (up to the 16th order) to enhance the intensity in numerous locations across the spectrum. Quasi-phase-matching adds a unique dimension to the design space for SCG waveguides, allowing the spectrum to be engineered for specific applications.},

However, the mechanism is not yet understood. Now, a series of compounds [(RSn)4 E6 ] (R=phenyl, cyclopentadienyl, cyclohexyl, benzyl, CH2 CH2 (C6 H4 )CO2 Et; E=S, Se), were prepared, characterized, and investigated for their nonlinear optical properties. With the exception of crystalline [(BnSn)4 S6 ], all these compounds exhibit WLG with similar emission spectra; slight blue-shifts are observed by introduction of cyclopentadienyl substituents, while the introduction of Se in the inorganic core can provoke a red-shift. These investigations disprove the initial assumption of an aromatic substituent being a necessary precondition; the precondition seems to be the presence of (cyclic) substituents providing enough electron density.},

 abstract = {We fabricated tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) channel waveguides and used them to experimentally demonstrate higher-order mode supercontinuum (SC) generation. The Ta2O5 waveguide has a high nonlinear refractive index which was in an order magnitude of 10-14 cm2/W and was designed to be anomalously dispersive at the pumping wavelength. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a higher-order mode femtosecond pump based broadband SC has been measured from a nonlinear waveguide using the phase-matching method. This enabled us to demonstrate a SC spectrum spanning from 842 to 1462~nm (at - 30~dB), which corresponds to 0.83 octaves, when using the TM10 waveguide mode. When using the TE10 mode, the SC bandwidth is slightly reduced for the same excitation peak power. In addition, we theoretically estimated and discussed the possibility of using the broadband higher-order modes emitted from the Ta2O5 waveguide for trapping nanoparticles. Hence, we believe that demonstrated Ta2O5 waveguide are a promising broadband light source for optical applications such as frequency metrology, Raman spectroscopy, molecular spectroscopy and optical coherence tomography.},
